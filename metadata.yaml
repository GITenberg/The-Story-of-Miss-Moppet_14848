description: "The Story of Miss Moppet is a tale about teasing, featuring a kitten\
  \ and a mouse, that was written and illustrated by Beatrix Potter. It was published\
  \ by Frederick Warne & Co for the 1906 Christmas season. Potter was born in London\
  \ in 1866, and between 1902 and 1905 published a series of small format children's\
  \ books with Warne. In 1906, she experimented with an atypical panorama design for\
  \ Miss Moppet, which booksellers disliked; the story was reprinted in 1916 in small\
  \ book format.\nMiss Moppet, the story's eponymous main character, is a kitten teased\
  \ by a mouse. While pursuing him she bumps her head on a cupboard. She then wraps\
  \ a duster about her head, and sits before the fire \"looking very ill\". The curious\
  \ mouse creeps closer, is captured, \"and because the Mouse has teased Miss Moppetâ€”Miss\
  \ Moppet thinks she will tease the Mouse; which is not at all nice of Miss Moppet\"\
  . She ties him up in the duster and tosses him about. However, the mouse makes his\
  \ escape, and once safely out of reach, dances a jig atop the cupboard.\nAlthough,\
  \ critically, The Story of Miss Moppet is considered one of Potter's lesser efforts,\
  \ for young children it is valued as an introduction to books in general, and to\
  \ the world of Peter Rabbit. The character of Miss Moppet was released as a porcelain\
  \ figurine in 1954 and a plush toy in 1973. The book has been published in a Braille\
  \ version, translated into seven languages, and was released in an electronic format\
  \ in 2005. First editions in the original format are available through antiquarian\
  \ booksellers.\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
